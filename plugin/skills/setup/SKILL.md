# Setup & repair

Get the server working, or diagnose why it isn't.

## Tools
`sign_in` · `list_environments`

## First-time setup
1. Ask whether they have already run `powerplatform-mcp-server --setup` in a terminal. If not, that is the fastest path — it creates the app registration, signs them in, and wires their AI client.
2. If they cannot use a terminal, call `sign_in`. It returns a device code and URL; the user completes sign-in in a browser, then you continue.
3. Confirm with `list_environments`. If that returns environments, the server is working.

## Diagnosing failures
Match the symptom before suggesting a fix:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `AADSTS65001` / "consent missing" | The app registration lacks a permission, or an admin never consented | An Entra admin must grant consent. Name the specific API from the error — re-running `--setup` does NOT grant consent |
| Tool is not in the list at all | Its feature is disabled in the permission profile | Re-run `--setup` and pick a profile that includes it |
| `403` on Dataverse, desktop flow, or work-queue tools | Missing the Dynamics CRM delegated permission | Add it in Entra and consent |
| `403` on connection create/test | Missing Power Platform API connectivity scopes | Add `Connectivity.Connections.Read/Write` and consent |
| Everything fails after months of working | Expired refresh token | `powerplatform-mcp-server --login` |

Never tell the user to re-run `--setup` for a consent problem — it cannot fix one.
